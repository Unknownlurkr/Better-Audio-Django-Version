dont touch manage.py 
DO NOT TOUCH manage.py

This django project is a WEBSITE that is
broken up into individual and different parts called APPS
(For example: video app that displays videos on the website)

If you can't explain what one APP does in one sentance without confusion
then the APP needs to be broken up more for a simple & short app description

create a app:python manage.py startapp YourAppName
for example: python manage.py startapp audio
for the audio app where users can upload their
audio files

4:
migrations-hook up and connect source code with database


8:After adding model before running: APPLY MIGRATIONS
enter the command: python manage.py makemigrations audio 
*migration is just a change to the database*
python manage.py sqlmigrate music 0001 <-migration ID
-> will create a table,table colums and rows(in sqlite)
database is synced with code: python manage.py migrate

note for later: 
#takes req and sends back an http response
from django.http import HttpResponse

#what you name here is the name of ur function
#always passing in a request
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("""<form method="POST">
  <input type="file" id="audioFile">
  <input type="submit">
</form>""") -> use for audio index 
(maybe change response to just a h2 heading)
or 
def audio(request):
    return HttpResponse("""<form method="POST">
  <input type="file" id="audioFile">
  <input type="submit">
</form>""") -> use for audio index 

database api in the python django shell
up = Upload(audioPath=r'C:\Users\bsamu\Documents\metaphoric\yalldontvote-VIRRRAAAUS.wav',creatorName="unknown rapper",userName="rapper123",userPassword="123",userEmail="email@email.com",audioTitle="VIRUUSS",audioDescription="2020 sucks")
for windows path need raw string for \ which is r'C:\path'
-> moren info https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18084554/why-do-i-get-a-syntaxerror-for-a-unicode-escape-in-my-file-path
createdObj.save() saves that to the database with save()

how to get into shell in current terminal with django:
python manage.py shell
to exit the shell: exit() and clear/clear() old shit with clear or exit

__ is known as a dund which is a double underscore
__str__ is called dunder string which is a method that builds a string representation of the object
